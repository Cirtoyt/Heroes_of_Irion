TODO:
- Add latest character images to player HUD
- Decide what to do with take cover party member action
    Or something else?
      Focus on large enemies or on nearest!! (code is in CheckForEnemyPresence)
- Decide what to do with character stats party member action
    Will I have a character UI with stats you can upgrade when the character is back at camp?
      Weapon damage?
      Health max?
      Movement speed?
        Movement & Attack combo speed stat?
      Maybe have upgrade station back at camp?
    Or something else?
    Swap class system (2 classes per character and swapping of weapons visible)?
      Much more doable than UI and character upgrading!

    Hitting enemies
